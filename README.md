## Context

Congratulations! You and your buddies just graduated college and have an amazing new idea for a startup: “The Costco hotdog price tracker”.  This app allows hungry patrons to figure out which Costco has the best price for food-court hotdogs without the need to drive all over town.  For inspiration, you folks were looking sites like GasBuddy and McBroken.
 
After your last final, you’re hanging out in your dorm room trying to figure out how to turn this amazing idea into the next billion-dollar Unicorn **(that will naturally never make a profit)** .     
Your buddy fires up their laptop and shows you the ‘hello-world’ version of the product and it’s your turn to get it into production.
 
When your buddy hands it off to you on a flash drive, you notice they have a Dockerfile they used in their local environment.
 
**Question 1:**
 
Please look at their Dockerfile  (attached) and:
1.	Summarize how you think the application works and identify any major components we’ll need to deploy.  
2.	Identify any smells or danger zones in the Dockerfile and indicate what you would do to improve them. 
3.	Remix this Dockerfile into something that can be deployed in an AWS and Kubernetes based environment. 
4.	Your buddy still needs a local development environment.  How would you align his local environment with your new production environment? 
 
Please return a Zip file including any project files you draft up.  We do not expect a fully working/deployable project.  As such, use your best judgement on where to include detail and where to stub things out.  
 
**Question 2:**
 
1.	As you were working through Question 1 what process, controls, tooling, features or automation did you need to solve as part of shipping this app and what did you consider but decide to defer?
2.	What problems did/would these items solve?
3.	What guided your decision to visit them ‘now’ or ‘later’? 
4.	For the deferred items, what timeframe would you anticipate until they become ‘now’ problems?
